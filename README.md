# all_cllassification_models
Tried Logistic Regression, KNN Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Classifier in same dataset.

I tried applying five Classification models on the same dataset
- Logistic Reression
- KNN Classifier
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Classifier

  PROBLEM STATEMENT

1. Check the dataset if it needs cleaning.
2. Check the dataset if it needs missing value treatment.
3. Check the dataset if it needs scaling.
4. Split data into training data and testing data.
5. Create various Classification models to predict purchased or not depending on various independent feature.
6. Check which model is giving best accuracy.

STEPS FOLLOWED

1. Importing required libraries.
2. Loading dataset.
3. Check first five rows of the dataset.
4. Creating a copy of the dataset.
5. Statistical info about dataset.
6. Getting information on dataset.
7. Encoding dataset.
8. Scaling the Dataset. I have used (standard scaler).
9. Splitting data into training set and testing set.
10. Importing five Classification models (Logistic Regression, KNN classifier, Decision Tree classifier, Random Forest classifier
    and Support Vector classifier.
12. Making objects of each model and creating a list of  the objects.
13. Iterating through the models list, fitting training data in each model one by one.
14. Making predictions with test data using each model one by one.
15. Checking accuracy of each model one by one.
16. Printing Confusion matrix of each model one by one.
